Parasitemias for PcAS and PcCB in mosquito-transmitted infections

Percentage of infected red blood cells counted in Giemsa stained thin blood films prepared from mice infected with PcCB and PcAS by mosquito bite, days 3-12 post-liver stage infection (i.e. days 5-14 post-mosquito bite)

Red blood cell counts for mosquito-transmitted infections with PcAS and PcCB

Red blood cell count in blood collected from mice infected with PcCB and PcAS by mosquito bite, days 3-12 post-liver stage infection (i.e. days 5-14 post-mosquito bite)

Relative ratios of parasite sequestration in different organs

Total flux (p/s) in the perfused ex vivo organs (raw data columns C-E) normalised to the peripheral blood luciferase activity (RLU) at late trophozoite stage (9:00am, column F; normalised data, columns G-I), days 6 and 9 post-liver stage infection (i.e. days 8 and 11 post-mosquito bite)
